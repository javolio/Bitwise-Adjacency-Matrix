Bitwise-Adjacency-Matrix
========================

A fairly simple tool for creating directed, unweighted graphs. Edges are stored in a bitwise adjacency matrix, minimizing memory usage. Both the addition and removal of edges are supported. Graphs can have any number of nodes. A good number of user commands are included. This could very easily be connected to a graphical interface of some sort.
